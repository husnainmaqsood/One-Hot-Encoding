# One-Hot-Encoding
When we have columns which have categorical data and these columns are important to use for training of our model, then we use the technique of One Hot Encoding also known as Dummy Variables. 
I have used pandas getdummies() function which takes as parameter the column to be encoded and gives us new encoded dataframe.
Then I concatenated that dataframe with our original daataframe.
